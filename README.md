# RetinalOCT

Retinal Optical Coherence Tomography

Retinal optical coherence tomography (OCT) is an imaging technique used to capture high-resolution cross sections of the retinas of living patients. Approximately 30 million OCT scans are performed each year, and the analysis and interpretation of these images takes up a significant amount of time (Swanson and Fujimoto, 2017).

This project aims at predicting

Categories :

1.Choroidal neovascularization (CNV) : with neovascular membrane and associated subretinal fluid.

2.Diabetic macular edema (DME) with retinal-thickening-associated intraretinal fluid.

3.Multiple Drusen present in early AMD. 

4.Normal retina with preserved foveal contour and absence of any retinal fluid/edema.

I have used VGG16 pre trained model
